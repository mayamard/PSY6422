> Sheet used: sheet 5 of 5. LT118_(unrounded). Unrounded figures used in this project for more accurate scaling when creating the "per 1000 people" figure
> Background: The housing supply: net additional dwellings statistics, also known as ‘net additions’, measure the absolute change in stock between one year and the next, including losses and gains from new builds, conversions, changes of use (for example a residential house to an office) and demolitions. For the purposes of the project, "new homes" was used to refer to these figures.
> Data sources: The sources of the net additions data are the Housing Flows Reconciliation (HFR), the Greater London Authority and Regional Assembly joint returns. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, all local authorities submitted data to CLG through the Housing Flows Reconcilation (HFR) form. Between 2004-05 and 2008-09 CLG worked jointly with Regional Planning bodies in the south and midlands on joint data returns in an attempt to ensure consistency between the net housing supply figures reported in regional Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs) and those published by central government.  Following the abolition of the Regional Planning Bodies in 2010, Local authorities in all regions except London have returned to submitting data via the HFR from 2009-10.

Background																									
The housing supply: net additional dwellings statistics, also known as ‘net additions’, measure the absolute change in stock between one year and the next, including losses and gains from new builds, conversions, changes of use (for example a residential house to an office) and demolitions. Table 118 gives the component breakdown at England and regional level in rounded (to the nearest 10) and unrounded tables.																									
Sources and data collection																									
The sources of the net additions data are the Housing Flows Reconciliation (HFR), the Greater London Authority and Regional Assembly joint returns. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, all local authorities submitted data to CLG through the Housing Flows Reconcilation (HFR) form. Between 2004-05 and 2008-09 CLG worked jointly with Regional Planning bodies in the south and midlands on joint data returns in an attempt to ensure consistency between the net housing supply figures reported in regional Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs) and those published by central government.  Following the abolition of the Regional Planning Bodies in 2010, Local authorities in all regions except London have returned to submitting data via the HFR from 2009-10. Data for London are supplied by the GLA. More detail can be found in the 'data collection' section in our technical notes for the release linked below:																									
Technical notes																									
Revisions																									
Census adjustments																									
These statistics are compared against the census on its release every 10 years to ensure that the sum of net additions over that period matches the difference between the latest census dwelling count and the previous one. The net additions figures are then adjusted, with any difference spread evenly across the 10 years since the previous census. The dwelling counts from the 2011 Census have been used to revise the net supply estimates from 2001-02 to 2010-11, and the dwelling counts from the 2021 Census have been used to revise the net supply estimates from 2011-12 to 2020-21. More detail can be found in the 'scheduled revisions' section of our technical notes for the release linked below:																									
Scheduled revisions																									
Scheduled revisions																									
Local authorities are able to revise the data they supply for these statistics after the original deadline for submission. In collecting the data for the 2019-20 publication, we allowed local authorities to revise data for the previous two years’ published figures. In the statistical releases following, the revisions period covers the previous years’ figures only. More detail can be found in the 'scheduled revisions' section of our technical notes for the release linked below:																									
Scheduled revisions																									
Response rate and imputation																									
The 2023-24 data in this table is derived from valid HFR 2023-24 returns submitted by 295 of 296 local authorities in England. Imputation is used for any authorities that do not supply data through the HFR form. This year, data was imputed for Ribble Valley.

Sheet 3: Notes

1	Rounding: estimates are presented unrounded. Unrounded estimates are published to enable and encourage further calculations and analysis. However, the estimates should not be taken to be accurate to the level of detail provided. More information on the accuracy of the estimates is available in the Quality and Methodology document (QMI).
2	Small counts: the estimates are produced using a variety of data sources and statistical models, including some statistical disclosure control methods, and small estimates should not be taken to refer to particular individuals.
3	Usual residence definitions: the estimated resident population of an area includes all those people who usually live there, regardless of nationality. Arriving international migrants are included in the usually resident population if they remain in the UK for at least a year. Emigrants are excluded if they remain outside the UK for at least a year. This is consistent with the United Nations definition of a long-term migrant. Armed forces stationed outside of the UK are excluded. Students are taken to be usually resident at their term time address.
4	Geography: where subnational level data are presented, the population estimates reflect boundaries in place as of April 2023. The term "local authority district" refers to geographical areas in the tables which are below regions and which are not counties or metropolitan counties. In England these include unitary authorities, metropolitan districts, non-metropolitan districts and London boroughs. In Wales they are known as unitary authorities, in Scotland as council districts and in Northern Ireland as local government districts. Further information can be found in the 'geography guide' worksheet.
5	Use of 2023 Local authorities: this spreadsheet uses boundaries for England and Wales that existed at publication, which includes the changes made in April 2023.
6	Revision to mid-2022 population estimates: Population estimates for mid-2022 have been revised to account for improvements to the disaggregation of international migration from the UK level down to local authority by age and sex.
7	Geographical coverage: these statistics cover England and Wales only. Estimates for the whole of the UK, covering mid-2023, will be published later in the year.
Issues affecting table MYE3	Note text
8	Internal migration: residential moves between different local authority districts in the UK, including those that cross the boundaries between the four UK nations: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Internal migration figures for Northern Ireland include flows to and from the Isle of Man. This means that net internal migration at UK level will not sum to zero.
9	Internal migration for counties, regions, England and Wales: we are only able to provide internal migration netflows for counties, regions and England and Wales for mid-2023; inflows and outflows are unavailable. This reflects a different supply of internal migration estimates for mid-2023 which is not as detailed our regular method. Further details can be found in our methodology guide. 
10	Other changes: changes to the size of armed forces stationed in the UK and other special population adjustments. At geographies higher than local authority, adjustments due to rounding may also be included. This means that other changes at local authority level may not sum to other changes at national level.
Issues affecting table MYE5	Note text 
11	Rounding: the population density estimates and area measurements are displayed rounded to the nearest integer though calculations have been performed on the unrounded data.
12	Definitions: Standard Area Measurements (SAM) data used reflect the position as at 31 December 2021 for England, Wales and Scotland. Land area measurements, excluding inland water, have been used in compiling these population density figures. Information on this is available from the ONS geography portal. For Northern Ireland SAM data consistent with that used in their 2021 census and mid-year estimate reporting has been used.
13	Changes: the area measurements are a definitive set derived from boundaries maintained by Ordnance Survey and Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland. The current measurements may differ from those published previously in tables, publications, or other statistical outputs, even allowing for boundary changes or changes to the physical structure of the land because of improvements to the source of the data.
