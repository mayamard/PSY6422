# Research Question
## How do units of housing supply completed in the last 12 years compare across regions of England when adjusting by regional populations?
Given the current housing crisis and shortage in the UK, I became interested in how different regions of England particularly are performing with their supply of new homes. I had a look into figures on gov.uk and found data on net additional dwellings completed, defined as "the absolute change in stock between one year and the next, including losses and gains from new builds, conversions, changes of use (for example a residential house to an office) and demolitions".

Given that bigger regions would have higher new housing figures, I found data on the population of regions by year from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to create a per 1000 people figure for a given region at a given year. This would allow easier comparisons across regions.

I decided on a line plot with "Year" on the X axis, and "New Homes completed per 1000", with 9 lines to represent each of the 9 English regions, displaying the trends over time. I also wanted an interactive element where users could compare, isolate, and zoom into areas and years of interest.

# Data Preparation
## Setting up & loading packages

The code below is the setup with the required libraries. Renv was used for package management, with package versions used listed in /renv.lock in the repository.

```{r setup & library, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, quiet = TRUE}

# Package version management: using "renv" package to ensure the packages used in this project are preserved if/when cloning
if(!require('renv')) install.packages('renv')
library(renv)
# Restores the environment from renv.lock file
renv::restore()
# My library:
# here determines the project root directory automatically and constructs file paths relative to that root, not the current working directory
library(here)
# readODS package needed to read the Net Additional Dwellings .ods dataset
library(readODS)
# readxl package needed to read the Regional Population .xlsx dataset
library(readxl)
# Library required for data wrangling: mainly using tidyr and dplyr from tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# ggplot2 allows for plotting with ggplot
library(ggplot2)
# plotly allows interactivity from ggplot plots. I like the use of plot zooming and custom hover text which is why plotly was used
library(plotly)

```

## Importing data
We will be merging these data sets so we get a figure of the number of new housing units relative to that region's population for a given year, by 1000 people, to allow regional comparisons. This means columns that need to be merged and therefore need to match by names are Region and Year.

I had a look at the data being used in Excel and as a tibble using View() after importing, so already have an idea of what needs to be edited.

```{r importing, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# here constructing file paths relative to the project root
# If downloading the data from sources, please ensure relevant data folder and file names below match
file_path_homes <- here("data", "raw_netadditionaldwellings.ods")
file_path_pop <- here("data", "raw_population.xlsx")

# Read data from the files
data_homes <- read_ods(file_path_homes, sheet = 5) #unrounded sheet for more accurate figures
data_pop <- read_xlsx(file_path_pop, sheet = 11) #mid-year population estimates 2011-2023

# See new imported data sets are correct and review what edits need to be made.
# Best to View in R initially
# Data needs to match by Year and Region, therefore need to ensure relevant wrangling is completed...

```

## Wrangle (Part 1/3): Net Additional Dwellings data

```{r wrangle net additional dwellings data}

# We are looking for regions of England, from 2011 to 2023 as no pre-2011 population data was available unfortunately
# As mentioned, ideally you'd View(data_homes) in R at this stage
# We need to remove blank columns and rows, remove the England column, rename Year column data to just numbers, remove pre-2011 data, and convert the regions to long

#remove 1st 2 rows as they are irrelevant 
data_homes <- data_homes[-1:-2, ]

#make first row the headings for columns, then delete first row
colnames(data_homes) <- data_homes[1, ]
data_homes <- data_homes[-1, ]

# Check if that looks right
head(data_homes) 

# Delete "England" column as we're just seeing regional differences
data_homes <- data_homes %>%
  select(-"England")

# Filtering for only Net data
data_homes <- data_homes %>% filter(
  str_starts(`Components of net housing supply`, "Net additions")
  )

# Can now delete this "Components of net housing supply" column as have used filters
data_homes <- data_homes %>%
  select(-`Components of net housing supply`)

# Rename Year as first 4 digits: cannot convert to numeric otherwise
data_homes$Year <- str_sub(data_homes$Year, 1, 4)

# Filter to remove pre-2011 data to match the data set with the population data we have
data_homes <- data_homes %>%
  filter(Year >= 2011)

# Make long
data_homes <- pivot_longer(data_homes, 
             cols = -Year, #all columns except Year as it's already long
             names_to = "Region",
             values_to = "New_Homes")

# Quick check whether we have missing data
is.na(data_homes)
#All values come back False, meaning no missing values

# Convert to numeric to allow plotting
data_homes <- data_homes %>%
  mutate(across(c(Year, New_Homes), as.numeric))

# How does it look?
print(data_homes)
# Looks good!

```

## Plot: Net Additional Dwellings data

```{r plot Net Additional Dwellings}

#Quick view of our data

plot_homes <- ggplot(data = data_homes, mapping = aes(
  x = Year, y = New_Homes, 
  group = Region, colour = Region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "New Homes added by Region, 2011-2023", 
         x = "Year", 
         y = "New Homes") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023))

print(plot_homes)
ggsave(plot = plot_homes, "plots/plot_newhomes.png")


```

## Wrangle (Part 2/3): Population data

```{r wrangle population data}

#Check imported data

#remove first column, no data
data_pop <- data_pop[ ,-1]

#rename headers as the first row, then remove first row
colnames(data_pop) <- data_pop[1, ]
data_pop <- data_pop[-1, ]

#rename just 1st col to Region to match New Homes data
colnames(data_pop)[colnames(data_pop) == "Name"] <- "Region"

#view only regional data
data_pop <- data_pop %>%
  filter(grepl("Region", Geography))

#remove Geography column as now not needed
data_pop <- data_pop[ ,-2]

#convert to long
data_pop <- data_pop %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Mid"),  # Select the year columns (2011, 2012, 2013)
    names_to = "Year",         # The new column for year
    values_to = "Population"   # The new column for population values
  )

# Remove 'Mid-' from the Year column
data_pop$Year <- gsub("Mid-", "", data_pop$Year)

#Change from UPPERCASE to LikeThis
library(tools)
data_pop$Region <- toTitleCase(tolower(data_pop$Region))

#Quick check whether we have missing data
is.na(data_pop)
#All values come back FALSE, meaning no missing values

#make numeric for plot
data_pop <- data_pop %>%
  mutate(across(c(Year, Population), as.numeric))

print(data_pop)

```

## Plot: Population

```{r population plot}

plot_pop <- ggplot(data_pop, aes(x = Year, y = Population, group = Region, colour = Region)) +

# Conclusions

My initial thoughts: I was quite surprised to see how few homes were being built - I'd expected more of a noticeable increase as years and populations increased. There is the obvious dip in 2020 and lag to 2021 due to halting construction activity, and it seems we're still in a sort of housing slog.

## Limitations & Future ideas

Although my project offers an interesting insight into new housing supply differences across English regions, it of course overlooks the contextual and political factors involved in housing supply. Economic conditions (e.g., unemployment, income levels), government policies (e.g., housing subsidies, planning permissions/ regulations) and details regarding types of housing or population density are not considered. Future projects may wish to investigate adjusting to these factors for a more nuanced insight.

My initial idea for this project was to use data on affordable units of housing available regionally and find proportions of net housing that are affordable, to see where in England there are the most affordable options (both ownership and rent) for housing. This fell short when I realised the affordable housing data is only available as a gross figure (i.e. not taking into account any losses of affordable housing), therefore any data presented would be misleading. This would be a really interesting future idea given the net data is published. There is some "Official Statistics in Development" data only on affordable housing for rent, if interested (see references).
